# SQL-Power BI-Project
In this project, I have used SQL to calculate DAX functions to generate more insights from the information and data available. To present the insights generated and for data cleaning, I have used Power BI.
I have analyzed and created visualisations for a pizza store to help them make important decisions to grow their business.
